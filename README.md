# Interactive Campaign Map

How-to guide available soon, requires [Zoomify](http://www.zoomify.com/free.htm). Demo available to view [here](https://hreikin.co.uk/interactive-campaign-map/interactive-campaign-map.html).

To run the demo map simply open the file named 'interactive-campaign-map.html' in a web browser. You should be greeted by the default map which shows the starting points of the demo campaigns players. The map works just like a normal map you would find on the likes of google with zooming and panning responding to input from a touch screen device or mouse like normal.Â 

You can click on the player icons to bring up popups and a layers filter is available in the top right corner. All marker icons can be customised to represent whatever you need but in this simple demo we only have 2, one for the players and one for battles. If you open up the layers control in the top right corner you can choose which map to show and there is also a filter for you to choose which markers you want to display on the map. These markers can all be clicked and include a popup which can be used to include whatever information you see fit.
