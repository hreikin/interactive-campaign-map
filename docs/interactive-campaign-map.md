Interactive Campaign Map
==========
## Description
The Interactive Campaign Map is designed to let campaign arbitrators and GM's create an interactive map for use in their tabletop or roleplaying games.

Once you have cloned this repository, to run the demo map simply open the file named 'interactive-campaign-map.html' in a web browser. You should be greeted by the default map which shows the starting points of the demo campaigns players. The map works just like a normal map you would find on the likes of google with zooming and panning responding to input from a touch screen device or mouse like normal.Â 

You can click on the player icons to bring up popups and a layers filter is available in the top right corner. All marker icons can be customised to represent whatever you need but in this simple demo we only have 2, one for the players and one for battles. If you open up the layers control in the top right corner you can choose which map to show and there is also a filter for you to choose which markers you want to display on the map. These markers can all be clicked and include a popup which can be used to include whatever information you see fit.

## Requirements
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) 1.3.1 (Or later).
- L.tileLayer.zoomify (Included). Originally taken from the [Leaflet.Zoomify](http://github.com/cmulders/Leaflet.Zoomify/) repository.
- Zoomify tile source. Zoomify Free is available from [here](http://www.zoomify.com/free.htm).

## Demo
A fullscreen demo is available to view [here](https://hreikin.co.uk/interactive-campaign-map/interactive-campaign-map.html).

## Compatibility
L.tileLayer.zoomify extends the original Leaflet TileLayer, so basically everything that `L.TileLayer` supports, is supported by the L.tileLayer.zoomify plugin.

## Basic Usage
A detailed guide is available to view [here](https://www.hreikin.co.uk/2018/06/03/user-guide-creating-an-interactive-campaign-map/). The official Leaflet documentation is available [here](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html).

Create the map and set a flat projection, as we are projecting an image. Then create the Zoomify tile layer.
```js
var map = L.map('mapid', { 
    crs: L.CRS.Simple,
});

var layer = L.tileLayer.zoomify('./interactive-campaign-map-start/{g}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg', {
    width: 8318, 
    height: 3640,
}).addTo(map);

map.fitBounds(layer.getBounds());
```

Declare which icons to use for the Player and Battle markers.
```js
var playerIcon = L.icon({
    iconUrl: 'images/players.png',
    iconSize: [38, 38],
});

var battleIcon = L.icon({
    iconUrl: 'images/battles.png',
    iconSize: [50, 50],
});
```

Declare the popup content for any Player or Battle popups.
```js
var redPlayerPopup = 'Player information can go here, it could include details such as army/gang/faction and a link to their list or roster. The icon can be set to any image, it could be either a profile picture of the player or a recognisable army/gang/faction mark.';
var turquoisePlayerPopup = 'Player information can go here, it could include details such as army/gang/faction and a link to their list or roster. The icon can be set to any image, it could be either a profile picture of the player or a recognisable army/gang/faction mark.';

Create the Player markers and set the latitude and longitude values and then pass any options for custom icon and custom popup values. Then create a group of Player markers to be added to the layer control and add the player markers group to the map.
```js
var redPlayer = L.marker([-10.0, 10.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(redPlayerPopup);
var lightGreenPlayer = L.marker([-21.0, 33.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(lightgreenPlayerPopup);
var yellowPlayer = L.marker([-25.0, 61.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(yellowPlayerPopup);
var bluePlayer = L.marker([-16.0, 85.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(bluePlayerPopup);
var orangePlayer = L.marker([-14.0, 116.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(orangePlayerPopup);
var purplePlayer = L.marker([-32.0, 122.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(purplePlayerPopup);
var greenPlayer = L.marker([-43.0, 97.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(greenPlayerPopup);
var darkBluePlayer = L.marker([-44.0, 73.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(darkBluePlayerPopup);
var lightBluePlayer = L.marker([-48.0, 49.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(lightBluePlayerPopup);
var turquoisePlayer = L.marker([-45.0, 16.0], {icon: playerIcon}).bindPopup(turquoisePlayerPopup);

var players = L.layerGroup([redPlayer, lightGreenPlayer, yellowPlayer, bluePlayer, orangePlayer, purplePlayer, greenPlayer, darkBluePlayer, lightBluePlayer, turquoisePlayer]).addTo(map);
```

Create the Battle markers for each stage and set the latitude and longitude values and then pass any options for custom icon and custom popup values. Then create a group of Battle markers for each stage to be added to the layer control.
```js
var redPlayerStage01Battle01 = L.marker([-3.5, 5.0], {icon: battleIcon}).bindPopup(redPlayerStage01Battle01Popup);

var turquoisePlayerStage02Battle01 = L.marker([-41.0, 48.0], {icon: battleIcon}).bindPopup(turquoisePlayerStage02Battle01Popup);

var battlesStage02 = L.layerGroup([redPlayerStage02Battle01, lightGreenPlayerStage02Battle01, yellowPlayerStage02Battle01, bluePlayerStage02Battle01, orangePlayerStage02Battle01, purplePlayerStage02Battle01, greenPlayerStage02Battle01, darkBluePlayerStage02Battle01, lightBluePlayerStage02Battle01, lightBluePlayerStage02Battle02, turquoisePlayerStage02Battle01]);
```

Create the switchable map layers and add them to the map. Width and Height of original image MUST be defined.
```js
var start = L.tileLayer.zoomify('./interactive-campaign-map-start/{g}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg', {
    width: 8318, 
    height: 3640, 
    tolerance: 0.9, 
    layers: [stage01, stage02, players, battlesStage01, battlesStage02],
    attribution: 'Map by <a href="https://hreikin.co.uk" target="_blank" alt="hreikin">@hreikin</a>'
    }).addTo(map),

    stage01 = L.tileLayer.zoomify('./interactive-campaign-map-stage-01/{g}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg', {
    width: 8318, 
    height: 3640, 
    tolerance: 0.9, 
    layers: [stage01, stage02, players, battlesStage01, battlesStage02],
    attribution: 'Map by <a href="https://hreikin.co.uk" target="_blank" alt="hreikin">@hreikin</a>'
    }),

    stage02 = L.tileLayer.zoomify('./interactive-campaign-map-stage-02/{g}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg', {
    width: 8318, 
    height: 3640, 
    tolerance: 0.9, 
    layers: [stage01, stage02, players, battlesStage01, battlesStage02],
    attribution: 'Map by <a href="https://hreikin.co.uk" target="_blank" alt="hreikin">@hreikin</a>'
    });
```

Create the baseMaps and overlayMaps layers and passes which map layers to include in the layers control. Then create the layers control and add it to the map.
```js
var baseMaps = {
    "Campaign Start": start,
    "Campaign Stage 01": stage01,
    "Campaign Stage 02": stage02
};

var overlayMaps = {
    "Players": players,
    "Stage 1 Battles": battlesStage01,
    "Stage 2 Battles": battlesStage02
    };

L.control.layers(baseMaps, overlayMaps).addTo(map);
```
