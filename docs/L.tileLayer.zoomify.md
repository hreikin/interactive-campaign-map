Leaflet.Zoomify
==========
## Description
A tiny simple plugin for [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) to load Zoomify tiles from the TileGroup directories. It also corrects the arbritary boundary tiles that do not always have the standard square dimensions.

## Requirements
- Leaflet 1.0.0-b1 (or later)
- Zoomify tile source

## Example
See the [example](http://cmulders.github.io/Leaflet.Zoomify/examples/hubble-image.html)

## Compatibility
Extends the original Leaflet TileLayer, so basically everything that `L.TileLayer` supports, is supported by this plugin.

## Usage
Just include the `L.TileLayer.Zoomify.js` file from the `src/` dir in your page and create Zoomify tile layer with your url:
```js
var layer = L.tileLayer.zoomify('http://thematicmapping.org/playground/zoomify/books/{g}/{z}-{x}-{y}.jpg', {
    width: 5472,
    height: 3648,

}).addTo(map);
```
